# Tic Tac Toe

## Approach
- Board initializes with a 2d array, with each element a nil value
- update_board method takes 3 arguments: row and column coordinates and an update value to replace the element with an 'X' or a 'O'
- game_over method currently works for a specific board layout


## Edge cases
- Can't overwrite a field
- Can only enter a X or O which must be capitalised
